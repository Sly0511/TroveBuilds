# Trove Calculation Tool

### About

This app was made with the goal of simulating the whole character sheet calculations from the ground up.
An attempt at creating a code base that in logic clones how the game calculates the stats displayed in game.

This app also is intended to offer tools and functionality that helps a player not only calculate the stats but also
have an overall understanding of how the game works.

### Features
- Trove Gem system fully simulated with some quality of life inputs added for testing.
- Mastery calculations of not only Mastery points and level but also the stats given by these.
- Discord Logins are supported with the goal of allowing me to save data for you to use on different sessions, the tokens that discord sends to my app are not saved on my server, they are instead encrypted on my server and then saved into your browser, this ensures that YOU own your own data and that if my server gets hacked, no information is leaked about you or your account.

### Contributions

You can contribute with code improvements with pull requests, though to be fair, I'll admire if you bother to read my code.

However, if you feel like it, you can snatch up a translation file or edit directly in github and pull request that I add your language, or even update a currently supported language.
Language files will be automatically and dynamically updated as I build the app further.

### Releases

- Releases are only web-based now, and thus you can see the current production build over at https://trovetools.slynx.xyz/ where the app will run hosted on my remote server routed through cloudflare

Yes, I ain't going to google "How to put nice badges in my md file on my github repo", that takes effort which I have spent it all on making this garbage.
