# Trove Calculation Tool

### About

This app was made with the goal of simulating the whole character sheet calculations from the ground up.
An attempt at creating a code base that in logic clones how the game calculates the stats displayed in game.

This app also is intended to offer tools and functionality that helps a player not only calculate the stats but also
have an overall understanding of how the game works.

### Features
- Trove Gem system fully simulated with some quality of life inputs added for testing.
- Mastery calculations of not only Mastery points and level but also the stats given by these.

### Contributions

You can contribute with code improvements with pull requests, though to be fair, I'll admire if you bother to read my code.

However, if you feel like it, you can snatch up the English translation file or edit directly in github and pull request that I add your language, or even update a currently supported language.
Language files will be automatically and dynamically updated as I build the app further.

### Releases

- I will be releasing compiled versions of my software, it's intended that you use the executable I provide in GitHub, avoid downloading it from anywhere else.
- The size is determined by the libraries I have installed pre compilation, I have made a python environment for this project to reduce clutter from the compilation process,
despite the code being relatively small and the assets not being as many as you'd like to explain the size of the executable, the reason it is so big is that it compiles a
working python "instance" that will run along with libraries I have installed and the code I made for this app, thus it has to contain some required criteria, and since I chose
to only have one file compiled instead of a directory, it means it'll contain DLL's and such in the exe itself.

### Antivirus Notes

- Your antivirus software might get mad at the fact there's a python instance in the executable, I can assure you it's safe to run
however you'll have to take my word for granted, coz my wallet ain't paying for a certificate for a fan project :)

Yes, I ain't going to google "How to put nice badges in my md file on my github repo", that takes effort which I have spent it all on making this garbage.
